# Autonomous Security Robot Project (Nexuni Intelligent Robot)
Nexuni Co. proposed solutions for smart security robots to reduce the labor need and increase operational efficiency in facilities management (See our website on [AMR Intro](https://www.nexuni.com/TechPage/amr)). It includes a highly intelligent Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) platform with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and algorithms to achieve robotic perception and decision making. The goal of the project is to develop an intelligent robot that is able to perform tasks and navigate autonomously without human intervention.  
The project is planned to be delivered in three phases:

(1) Deliver a robot prototype with basic SLAM and obstacle avoidance on the application of smart bin collection.
(2) Deliver a robot prototype (Security Robot) with the additional features of streaming live video to central control, robot patrolling based on pre-set routes, capability to remote control the robot from central control.
(3) Development and integration of the following features on the robot prototype.

	- Detect suspicious objects (unattended bags and vehicles)
	- Provide human detection and tracking
	- Provide people counting in restricted regions
	- Remotely define the restricted regions and region of interest for video analysis
	- Provide face recognition for important/suspicious people

The company is dedicated to delivering automation solutions to decrease the need of labor forces and enhance operational excellence. (See our [website](www.nexuni.com) for more information.) Mobility is one of the keys to most of our automation solutions. Our robotics and indoor positioning expertise made it possible to build robots that navigate to a specific location and perform tasks.
