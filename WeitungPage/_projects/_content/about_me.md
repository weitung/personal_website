Hello, I’m **Weitung**! MIT EECS PhD Student at the [Signal Kinetics Group](https://signal-kinetics.media.mit.edu/). I received my Bachelor’s and Master's degree in EECS at MIT, and my research interests focus on **IoT, AI, and robotics**. I love doing hands-on works that can bring my ideas to solve real-world challenges. While in my second year at MIT I teamed up with friends and started a company called [**Nexuni, Co.**](https://www.nexuni.com). The goal is to develop affordable intelligent automation solutions to help clients manage their businesses and improve quality of life in the cities.

My years at MIT have helped me lay rigorous theoretical foundations in the fields of **AI, systems, and robotics**. Starting a company with intense R&D works has provided me with tremendous experience in the techniques of rapid prototyping and then integrating these quick creations into the development of various technologies for evaluation. My current PhD research focuses on battery-free localization systems and their potential to enable new forms of perception and autonomy. I will continue to use my knowledge and experience to work on things that impact the world.
